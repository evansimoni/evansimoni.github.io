      <h2>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h2>
      <p>
        When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?<br>
        Accomplishment Adventure Affection Ambition Autonomy Challenge Community Competence Competition Cooperation Creativity Enthusiasm Friendships Growth Health Helping other people Insight Inspiration Intellectual status Introspection Knowledge Music Nature Persistence Personal development Physical challenge Quality Recognition Romance Tranquility Truth
      </p>

        Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.<br>
        Cooperation is important to me for a few reasons. At a fundamental level, humans are wired to be social. We are inherently social because cooperation was at once time fundamental to our survival as a species. Today, that is not necessarily the case, but it is an incredibly useful and engaging exercise. Cooperation gets stuff done, it builds relationships of trust and it taps into a historically significant aspect of our brains.

        What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?<br>
        My mom was the last person to ask me for advice. She needed help with her Mac since she's not very familiar with computers. I helped her solve an issue with a software update that was taking to long too install. This is not at all a representative sample of the type of advice I give. In fact, it's difficult for me to determine if there is any topic that I give more advice on than others. I tend to just drop my two cents on something when it seems appropriate in the hopes that it might be useful, because I like helping people out.

        How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?<br>
        When I think about my values, I don't think about them as a list of nouns as I have listed above. I do find myself thinking about my values very often but I tend to think about them in terms of how I will be exercising them in the present and developing them in the future. I feel motivated and stimulated when I think about my values, and I do this by reminding myself of my goals every day. As for combating stereotype threat, I think the best thing you can do when you recognize it affecting you is to ignore the symptoms and assumptions you make about yourself. As Bob Dylan once said, "All I can do is be me, whoever that is."

        Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?<br>
        There are a few things that I like to do when I am stressed out or feeling down. When I am feeling overwhelmed, stuck or stressed out I will sometimes walk way and sit alone and let my mind wander. Sometimes it helps me to talk about my frustrations with someone else. Even if they're unable to help me in any way, it just feels better to have someone else know what I'm experiencing. Another technique to burn off stress is to go swimming. This tends to help me forget about what is bugging me and it gets my endorphins flowing so I feel better.
