      <h1>Functional vs. Object Oriented</h1>
      <p>
        From what I understand, Object Oriented and Functional are fundamentally different approaches to writing programs with the main difference residing in their approach to how the code is organized. Object Oriented programming has to consider a structural design where pieces of the program are compartmentalized whereas Functional programming displays code in a linear fashion without explicitly acknowledging how the various pieces of the program work together. In Functional programming, the data are decoupled from from the functions that act on them but in Object Oriented programming they are bundled together into Objects.

        <b>Functional Programming</b><br>
        Programs written in the functional paradigm have placed an emphasis on computation to be the evaluating factor. It produces results based solely on the on inputs to the functions. This is different from OO in that it completely avoids state and mutable data, meaning everything is always in the same state and all data is accessible to all parts of the program. Calling a function twice with the same inputs will always return the same output because there is no state.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Object Oriented Programming</b><br>
        Programs written in an OO style emphasize separating the data and functions into their own unique and distinct compartments known as Objects. This is useful because these objects have unique control over their data and functions as well as control over how other objects can access them. While functional programming relies on being able to access only the data types built into the language, OO enables the creation of new data types (objects). These objects can contain custom methods and variables of different scope. Object oriented programming is open-ended. If written correctly, an OO program will become a unique programming language that is specifically tailored to your purpose.
