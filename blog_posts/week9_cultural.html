      <h2>Asking the right questions</h2>
      <p>
        Analyze some of the questions you've asked (either the community, a friend, or yourself). Were these good questions? What was good/not so good about them? How could you make them better so you are more likely to get an answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In looking back at the Google+ community I realized I only asked a few questions. I tended to look for answers online or directly consult with another student. Some things that may have contributed to my lack of question-asking was that I fell behind early on, and started seeing questions answered before I had a chance to encounter them on my own (which was helpful!), but it may also be due to the fact that I became self-conscious of my earlier questions because they didn't always receive the response I had hoped for. Nevertheless, the quality and specificity of my questions can certainly be improved. I'm glad that I'm now being asked to research how to ask good questions because it will make me think about it whenever I need to pose technical questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first questions I asked in the G+ forum: <br>
        <br>
        "I've been working through the challenges this week and added my first two reflections through GitHub's site as instructed. However, I'm not able to see the updated files on my desktop despite having synced repositories through the GitHub app for Mac. What is going on here?
        <br>
        Also, I'm getting confused navigating the GitHub site trying to view my updated reflection files. I notice there are many branches/forks (same thing?) listed on the pages as I try find my reflections but it seems to be switching away from my branches (auto-titled 'patch-1' and 'patch-2'). Do I need to merge these onto my master branch? Why wasn't this done when I synced my repo from GitHub for Mac?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Another question I asked on the forum:
        <br>
        "Regarding the instructions for reviewing other people's work on GitHub (at the end of "week 1: get to know your group") -- Which pages of our peer's work are we expected to review?
        <br>
        Also, are we expected to review one from the accountability group and one other outside of the group as instructed in "how to review other's solutions"? Or just one as instructed at the end of 'get to know your group'?"
      </p>
      <p>
        My first set of questions were seriously lacking in specificity. I remember thinking this when I asked it but I was really desperate for help, so I went ahead with it. I guess I was hoping someone would introduce me to a good guide or source, which I suppose is what I should have asked for in the first place. I also should have listed some code, error messages or a scenario that gave rise to the issue I was having. In this case a step by step of what I did, to recreate the situation that confused me. As for the second part of that post, I think I let my emotional struggle interfere with how I was posing the question. I should have laid it out in a more linear way that made it easier to see what my issue was straight away. I'll set a mental note to not let my frustration come through into my question writing because it will probably be a hindrance to getting the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        My next question started off well, but then I lost specificity in my wording. I know this because, reading it now, the second half of the post doesn't make much sense to me. I can't figure out why I used the word 'also' when it seems like I am just expanding on details of my first request. This case was better than my first one but only because it was more logistical than technical.
