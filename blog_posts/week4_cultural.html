			<h2>Issues in Tech: The underrepresentation of women and minorities</h2>
			<p>
				It's no secret that the tech industry in dominated by younger people. What's talked about less often is the lack of diversity among this demographic. Most of these young people are men, and they are mostly white. These two disparities may have wide reaching and potentially unforeseeable consequences. The most pervasive and immediate however is the lack of perspective that would be present if more women and minorities worked in tech and new how to code. Because they are underrepresented, their influence in problems that affect them and their communities is not being addressed with the same immediacy as those who currently occupy the majority of the industry. There are two trends that have contributed to this problem.
			</p>
			<p>
				1) Advances in electronic technology, and computers especially, are tools that have appealed more to men than women since their commercialization. This may be in part due to a male biological disposition to seek out and understand tools, but it is probably cultural in nature too. Boys and men became target demographics for those marketing computers and technology. This targeting may inadvertently direct women's attention away from these products as they became increasingly associated with male culture. <br>
				2) White privilege runs deep in our culture. Today that means that whites are disproportionately more educated and receive more exposure to computers, the Internet, advances in technology and the job opportunities that exist within the industry.
			</p>
			<p>
				Given what I understand to be the causes of the disparity in the industry, there are a few things that can be done to rectify the situation.<br>
				1) At a national level, eduction reform could mandate formal education for computer and programming concepts. That way every child would (in theory) have an opportunity to be introduced and further explore technology.<br>
				2) More private programs can be established to promote exposure and encourage women and minorities to get into tech and programming. These programs should highlight the current disparity and inform people on why there needs to be a demographic shift.<br>
				3) Companies that currently market mostly to men can refocus their advertising campaigns to attract women. Women shop more than men and companies stand to gain additional customers if they can successfully reign in more women. This may serve to eliminate the gender bias that permeates our culture's perception of technology users.
