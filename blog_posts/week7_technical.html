      <h2>SQL vs. NoSQL</h2>
      <p>
        SQL databases are known as relational databases because they maintain data within a structure of tables allowing all the data to be related and called through SQL statements. NoSQL databases are usually not relation, but they may be. NoSQL database data is key value pairs, graphs, documents or wide column stores, none of which conform to the standard schema of a SQL database. Both of these database configurations offer advantages over one another. The purpose and function of a database should be considered before either of these is implemented in a project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every SQL database contains tables with an expandable number of columns and an expandable number or rows. This allows the maintenance of correlated, organized data with a high degree of integrity. Because of this structure, a single querying language has emerged that works similarly across all SQL vendors. NoQSL on the other does not adhered to a single convention and is therefore subjected various querying methods dependent on the particular organizational approach. A normal SQL database is "vertically scalable", meaning that it can be expanded on a single machine by increasing the computing power of the machine to keep up with the increased size of the database. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are "horizontally scalable", meaning they can be expanded by adding more servers so spread the computing load around between machines.
      </p>
      <p>
        SQL databases are good for complex querying because the structured language provides the ability for a lot of specificity. NoSQL databases are generally less specific, and are therefore less suited to handle complex querying, such as a bank's database. NoSQL is actually better at storing hierarchical data because it can be stored in key value pairs, much like data in JSON. While NoSQL is highly preferred for very large data sets, SQL is better off used for heavy duty transactional applications because it more stable and can more easily handle complex requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since SQL databases share a common language convention and are supported by several major vendors it is much easier to receive support for them. Databases that use NoSQL don't offer the same amount of formal support although they all have their own support niches online where problems can be researched and solved. There are also not many database experts who could help set up a NoSQL database, it is something that is usually set up and managed in-house.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point I can't say which of these databases I'm looking forward to working with more since I've only had experience using SQL relational databases. I do look forward to using and understanding how NoSQL databases work because it seems like they are the new (tech) kid on the block that a lot of companies want to employ because they can more easily handle large data sets.
