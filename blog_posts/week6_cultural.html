      <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
      <p>
        As a white male, it wasn't easy for me to immediately recognize situations where I have been affected by stereotype threat. However, after giving it some thought, I've had to deal with it throughout my life in many different scenarios. Stereotype threat is a concept that is applicable outside of race and test taking scenarios--it's a phenomenon that can take hold in any scenario where you could be judged against a stereotype that has been applied to you. I've been stereotyped and have even placed myself into stereotypes. In both cases there are times when I felt pressure to not conform to the negative associations of the stereotype.

        At different points in my life I have been identified as a nerd (when I started wearing glasses in 2nd grade), as a jock (later in high school and in college) and I even once placed myself into a stereotype of someone who is not not inclined to the hard sciences or math.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a long time I embraced the nerd stereotype because it identified me as someone who had all the answers and was studious, both of which were things I strived for in school as a competitive young schoolboy. In retrospect, it was a dangerous position to occupy because it allowed me to become complacent in my drive because everyone treated me as if I was the most intelligent student already. As I approached high school though, I felt the pressure of stereotype threat because "nerds" aren't "cool". I tried to dispel my identity as a nerd by keeping silent unless called on in classes and by wearing contacts en lieu of glasses. Unfortunately, I adopted a less serious approach to my education during my freshman year of high school, where I received my lowest marks in all of my years in school.

        My tenure as a nerd ended in my mind when the high school swimming season started my freshman year. I had been swimming competitively since the age of seven but now my success was being recognized in the city newspaper and by my high school peers. I donned a letterman's jacket at the end of the season and started to get comfortable with the star athlete /jock identity. In a way, stereotyped threat may have helped me turn my grades around. Now, recognized as an athlete, I was careful to avoid the "dumb jock" stereotype. I started to care about grades again to avoid conforming to the negative aspects of this stereotype.

        I was very scared of failure in high school, and it's still a fear that I carry with me everyday. At least now I'm aware of it and can combat the inhibiting effects when they rise up. What this meant was that I was averse to engaging in subject matter that was unfamiliar to me--not a good approach for someone who was supposed to be getting an education. At some point in high school--perhaps it was after getting low marks in geometry or being confused by the utility of chemistry--I decided that I wasn't a strong candidate for the hard sciences. I decided I wasn't mathy and I that these subjects were boring. In retrospect, this was just a way to avoid potential failure in these subject areas. I graduated high school with the notion that I could never be successful studying science and never gave the hard sciences a shot in college. I think stereotype threat convinced me to think this way and it reinforced my fear of failure.
