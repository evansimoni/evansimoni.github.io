      <h2>Ruby Classes</h2>
      <p>
        As an object oriented program, Ruby works with classes to create objects. A class is essentially a blueprint for an object and these objects can be created using predefined classes. As a blueprint, classes can contain methods, which will define behavior, and variables which will define the attributes. Once a class is created it can be used to quickly produce instances of the class, also known as class objects. This is useful because it helps eliminate repetitive code and makes it easier to make changes later on.
      </p>
      <p>
        How about an example? Let's say we want to create a medley relay at a swimming meet. The relay that we create will be an instance of the MedleyRelay class. Every MedleyRelay will have to take a few attributes including the team name, swimmers names, a lane and an entry time. Every relay object that is created will be distinct from the others thanks to these characteristics. Let's go ahead and create the class.
      </p>
      <pre>
      <code>
        class MedleyRelay
        end
      </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Creating a class is that easy! Make sure your class name is capitalized and written in camel case if it contains more than 1 word. Like I mentioned, this class should include a few characteristics. We can include these in the class by using the initialize method. This is a special method that lets us pass characteristics into a new instance of our class. These characteristics will be defined as instance variables.
      </p>
      <pre>
      <code>
        class MedleyRelay
          def initialize (team, time, backstroker, breastroker, butterflyer, freestyler)
            @team = team
            @time = time
            @backstroker = backstroker
            @breastroker = breastroker
            @butterflyer = butterflyer
            @freestyler = freestyler
          end
        end
      </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The @ symbol in front of the variables indicates that these variables are instance variables. Instance variables can be accessed across methods for any particular object. This is different from a a local variable which can only be accessed within the method in which it was assigned. To illustrate this example I will create a method that will print out a script for the meet announcer to read when the relay steps up to race.
      </p>
      <pre>
      <code>
        class MedleyRelay
          def initialize (team, time, backstroker, breastroker, butterflyer, freestyler, lane)
            @team = team
            @time = time
            @backstroker = backstroker
            @breastroker = breastroker
            @butterflyer = butterflyer
            @freestyler = freestyler
            @lane = lane
          end

          def script
            p "Swimming for #{@team} in lane #{@lane} with an entry time of #{@time}, #{@backstroker}, #{@breastroker}, #{#butterflyer} and #{@freestyler}!"
          end
        end        
      </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        As you can see, the script method is calling on the instance variables from the initialize method. These variables would be accessible across all methods in the class were I to define more of them. Things an object knows about itself are the instance variables, things an object can have done are the methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that we've written the MedleyRelay class, created the initialize method and the script method, it's time to show off how it all comes together. To see it work we have to create a new instance of the class then call the script method on it. I will create a new instance of the class MedleyRelay called american_400_medley and pass in the characteristics from the 2012 Olympic Games.
      </p>
      <pre>
      <code>
        american_400_medley = MedleyRelay.new("USA", "3:29.35", "Matt Grevers", "Brendan Hansen", "Michael Phelps", "Nathan Adrian", 4)

        american_400_medley.script
      </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The code above should print the following: <br>
        Swimming for USA in lane 4 with an entry time of 3:29.35, Matt Grevers, Brendan Hansen, Michael Phelps and Nathan Adrian!
