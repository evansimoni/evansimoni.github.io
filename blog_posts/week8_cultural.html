      <h2>Dealing With Conflict</h2>
      <p>
        Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened? What was the source of the conflict? How did you handle that conflict? Did your actions make the conflict better or worse? If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything? What did you learn from this experience? <br>

        During college I was a member of the swimming team. Every year, after the new year, it was expected that all members of the team would abstain from drinking for the rest of the season until the conference meet, which is at the beginning of March. In 2011, my 21st birthday fell in the second week of this 'dry season'. I decided to make an exception for myself and went out to drink with some friends that night. My roommates knew I went out and reported what I had done to the head coach. At the time I felt indignant and somewhat entitled, it was my 21st, after all. When the coaches found out, I had to apologize to the team and face some punishment for breaking a team rule. I was terribly ashamed and angry and felt disrespected by my roommates.

        The next few weeks were very difficult for me because I had trouble reconciling my feelings. Deep down I knew what I did was wrong, but at the same time I felt betrayed by my roommates--why couldn't they have let it slide? It was shocking to me that they would put our relationship at risk to enforce a team rule. For a little while I ignored them and refused to talk with them. I would avoid them and find other places to hang out or just stay in my room. I knew that this couldn't go on so I started to do some soul searching. I had to make myself realize that what I had done was wrong and that my roommates were just trying to uphold the integrity of the team. Finally I gathered the courage to meet with them to apologize for being angry with them. I explained that I understood why they had done what they had done and that it was really difficult for me to come to the conclusion that they had done the right thing. It was a very humbling experience and I felt very vulnerable afterward. Luckily our relationship was restored over the next few weeks.

        While it's not something that I ever talk about with them, or something that I even think back on very much, I recognize that there are things I could have done better or entirely different (this notion could be applied across my entire college experience). For one, I would not have gone out to drink in the first place. However, assuming I had still gone out to drink, I would have faced up to my wrongdoing right away and been more forthright in my apology. I would have welcomed the humility sooner, rather than struggle through many emotions to finally end up there. How I reacted was probably necessary for me, since I had to learn that lesson somehow. For most of my life I've been someone who's been by the book and followed all the rules. This was a rare and severe example for me to face some consequences for deviating from what I should have known was right. All in all, it was a very valuable lesson and I don't think I would be quite the calm, humble, introspective person I am today had this not happened.
