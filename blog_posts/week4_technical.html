			<h2>Teach about Enumerable Methods: Enumerable#map</h2>
			<p>
				The .map method falls under the Enumerable mixin (mixin is a class which contains a combination of methods from other classes). The Enumerable mixin comprises a collection of methods that can iterate over, search and sort on objects.
			</p>
			<p>
				.map returns an array by iterating through the object that it is called on. As .map iterates through the object it runs a block on each item and passes the result into the array that will be returned. Take a look at the syntax:
			</p>
			<p>
				1. map { | obj | block } => array <br>
				2. map => an_enumerator
			</p>
			<p>
				In case 1 .map is running a block of code on the object upon which it was called. The variable obj is placed between pipes as a stand in for the object that will be passed in each time map iterates over the object it has been called on. The right side of the hash rocket is the array that is returned. Case 2 represents what happened when no block is defined--an enumerator is returned (although I'll admit that I don't understand how this is generated or what is represents).
			</p>
			<p>
				The .map method can be used in any situation when you need to run a block of code on each item in an array. For example: if I wanted to see the projected value of each of my shares of a stock if they rose by 50% from their current price, I would just multiply their values in a block (this assumes I bought one share at each of the following prices).
			</p>
			<p>
				stock_values_in_dollars = [11, 15, 8, 20] <br>					
				stock_values_in_dollars.map { | dollar_value | dollar_value * 1.5 } <br>
				=> [16.5, 22.5, 12.0, 30.0] <br>
			</p>
			<p>
				As you can see the output is the value of each stock if it rose 50% from its current price. .map checked each index in the array and returned the new, higher values.
