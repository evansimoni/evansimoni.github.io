      <h2>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        Pairing sessions have been nothing like what I was expecting. I supposed it was naive of me to come in with expectations, but nevertheless I have been pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoy pairing. It forces me to communicate and think out loud and it allows me to get work done quicker and learn from my pairing partner.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I've come to find out, solving problems while pairing can help the process along in many ways, including reaching a solution more quickly. I've come to appreciate how working with someone else allows two people' experiences to come out and has the potential to bring twice as many routes to the solution had I been pairing alone. I enjoy the social aspect of pair programming and how it kind of just feels like hanging out while also getting work done. I have made some solid connections with the people I have paired with and we have a good rapport where it's OK to get off topic and crack jokes here and there to break up the work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most fun and rewarding part of pair programming is when you reach the solution. It's really fun to share a success with someone else and I really relish the moment when we both realize that our thoughts, communication and combined strategy have contributed to some working code. I often exclaim "YES!" when I finish a challenge. That's not to say that pair programming is without it's challenges and frustrations. The most difficult part for me is when one person is having trouble communicating what they intend to do, or what they don't understand. I have been on both sides of this situation plenty of times and I realize that it's part of the process. Continuing to practice pair programming will teach me how to to best handle this. I wouldn't be surprised if it's something that doesn't concern me down the line in my career.

        I'm somewhat ambivalent about reading feedback. While I know that it should be valuable, I also feel like what people have written about me is what I already know about myself and how our particular session went. Then again, now that I've written that, I see the value in having it spelled out for me. That way it prevents me from deluding myself in any way. The feedback is there and it's straight up, no doubt about how I did and what can be improved. The best feedback I've received has been the specific suggestions to clearly define the driver and navigator roles. Come to think of it, this has been the most difficult part for me to stick to. Whenever I jump into a challenge with someone, I want to start making changes and writing code, that is if I know what I want to do. I've realized its good to force yourself into one role or the other because it prods you to communicate and this is critically important in understanding each other's strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I must admit that I don't really enjoy writing feedback. Having just written that I feel selfish now, but I suppose this is a valuable exercise in that it revealed that. I think part of my problem is that I don't like to be critical of people. I need to just get over that. The other issue is that I'm lazy right after I finish a pairing session and end up putting off the feedback for later. This means that I have to recall what happened in the session and what exactly was feedback-worthy. I need to get in the habit of submitting feedback right after I finish pairing.
      </p>
      <p>
        All things considered, I am extremely pleased by the pairing and feedback approach to guiding our learning. I can't imagine what my learning process would look like if we weren't doing what we're doing. It's great.
