      <h1>What is Rails?</h1>
      <p>
        Ruby on Rails, often referred to as simply Rails, is a full-stack open source web framework. This means that a developer can write a fully functional web application, including the back end (database), page logic and front end, with this single tool. Rails is designed with many conventions in mind and has been designed to make the process as simple and easy as possible for the developer by packaging all the concepts into a single bundle that operates seamlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rails employs a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework to organize an application. In standard practice, the Model maps to tables in the database and a Ruby file. For example, a class 'Students' would be defined in a students.rb file in the app/models directory and then link to a table 'students' in the database. It is part of the RoR convention to use a consistent naming structure between these components.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Controller is the portion of an application that sits between the model and the view. The controller contains the logic to fetch objects from the database using the Model and then passes them to the View to be rendered on the page. Controller have different actions to perform to respond to certain web browser actions and requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The View takes data from the Controller and produces the HTML output for the web browser. Convention states that all modeling and formatting should occur in the View, leaving the Model and Controller to their own roles. In the default configuration, the View is stored in a .erb file which is compiled to HTML when it is run, but there are other templating systems that can be used for views.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the MVC, Rails comes with the ability to install gems, Ruby's nickname for a package that adds or extends functionality to an application. As Ruby has been updated over the years, it has included built in functionality from other languages and conventions so that they are the standard within the framework. This has served to provide more utility and easier conventions for programmers. Popular additions to Rails include Script.aculo.us, jQuery, CoffeeScript and SASS.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I mentioned, Rails follows a few conventions that guide the design and deployment. The first is 'Convention over Configuration' (CoC). This refers to how a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of an application because the rest is taken care of automatically, as in the 'Students' examples above. This convention leads to less code written, less repetition and more consistency. This leads to the next big convention of Rails: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). This means that information for an application should be stored in a single logical place and not repeated in other areas of the application.
