				Why is JavaScript popular in web development? What are the great things about JavaScript? What are it's limitations?
			</h2>
			<p>
				The answers to these questions have evaded me ever since I heard someone utter the word 'Javascript'. For too long I have not understood very much about it, even as I have gotten my hands dirty with other programming languages. Now that I'm finally delving into JS it's about time for me to give myself some context on its utility and application.
			</p>
			<p>
				Why is JavaScript popular in web development? My reseach online took me to a source claiming that JS is the 'ultimate scripting language'. Skeptically, I read on. Javascript is apparently very easy to learn (this has not been my experience in the last week) and edit. There are a plethora of libraries built just for use with JS--this is cool because it takes out a lot of the groud work and enables developers to create working programs/apps/websites in a fraction of the time it would take to do it from scratch. JS is also very fast. This is thanks to the fact that it runs client-side thus reducing the burden on the host server. JS is supported in every browser and JSON, XML and AJAX all work because of JS. Admittedly, I had to reseatch what these things are--they basically add the ability for a webpage to send and load data in the background and refresh components of a page without reloading everything. In addition to all its client-side capabilities, JS can also be used as a server-side language, eliminating the necessity for other languages to be used server-side.

				What are the great things about JavaScript? JS has lots of tools that are built for it, including a host of debugging tools, making it an easy language to debug. JS also encourges object oriented design which enables easier problem solving and design in programs. Someone on a forum was also extolling the psychological benefits of JS, claiming that since you see your resluts immediately you will stay inspired and motivated. I am looking forward to this moment--so far I have been motivated but not inspired by JS. Finally, it is everywhere and growing in popularity, making it a commodity skill in the marketplace.
			</p>

				What are it's limitations? My research led me to discover a few disadvantages and limitations to JS. For one, it is prone to security breaches. It is also prone to rendering variations because not all the browser will process the code in exactly the same way. Moreover, JS cannot access pages on other domains, it cannot access databases and it cannot write files to a server. Finally, the fact that browsers enable people to disable JS on their machines can lead to issues in processing websites that run JS.
