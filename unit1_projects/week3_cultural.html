			<h2>Thinking Style and Looking Ahead</h2>
			<p>
				I have identified my thinking style to be 'concrete sequential'. Now, I realize that I am not bound to thinking this way, but it is how I have self-identified in the past and it is what I am most comfortable with. On one hand this has worked pretty well with the Phase 0 curriculum--it is doled out in order with lots of instructions and steps to follow to ensure that learning is taking place. On the other, this may be bad for me because it is habituatiing me to what I am already confortable with. Regrettably, the parts that give me the most anxiety are the guided pairing sessions because they are unpredictable. I also get frustrated when an assignment's directions are unclear or an assignment is open ended. Thinking about what to include in this post actually helped me identify those problems. I need to change my attitude concerning unpredictability, clarity and openness. Actively engaging a growth mindset in these cases will help me get more out of my experience at DBC.

				I think I need to relax more too. I catch myself being too concerned about reading every possible legit source / completing every recommended tutorial / watching every informational video on a single subject. I need to remember that I will get more out of my time by DOING as opposed to consuming information. Consumption doesn't stick as well as active learning. My plan of action moving forward is to look at the work first and try to get it done (using references as needed). Then I can review additional materials when I have free time. I think this will serve to quell my anxieties about not getting all the work done by the end of Sunday. In the spirit of the growth mindset I want to expand my range of thinking styles. I think I can do this by talking about it when I pair up with others. I will pose direct questions to them about their thinking styles, how they approach the work, what they like and don't like about it and how they overcome the drawbacks. This will give me more perspective, hopefully enabling a shift in mindset.
