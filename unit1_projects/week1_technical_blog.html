			<h2>Technical Blog: My Favorite Websites</h2>
			<p>As someone who spends nearly a third of his life using the internet, I had a tough time choosing just three of my favorite websites. Nevertheless, I tried to vary my selection-each website I chose has a different focus.  I visit them on a weekly basis.</p>
			<h3><a href="http://www.medium.com">Medium.com</a></h3>
			<p>I like to spend some of my free time doing casual reading. Medium is a great place for topic-specific content and opinions from people whose writings wouldn't normally reach large audiences. I appreciate how they encourage non-writers to cover whatever they fancy-this has given rise to some really interesting and unusual pieces. At first I was skeptical that Medium would have any success given the prominence and availability of other blogging/writing platforms, but through their marketing and design they've found a new niche. Their organizational structure and algorithms have made it easy to follow writers with small audiences and regular-folk-turned-writers, for that matter. A few examples of collections (groupings of writings with similar topics or themes) I follow: "Adventures in Consumer Technology", "Best Thing I Found Online Today", "Anthropology and Algorithms", "Surviving The Future". I picture Evan Williams (the creator), jotting down a few keywords on a napkin as he formed the idea for the site: social, accessible, multi-focal, community, conversation, democratic.</p>
			<p>Medium's design is minimalistic and clean, with a simple side menu and few buttons. It is really easy to navigate and figure out what to do next. They've made it a breeze to get signed up and reading or writing-all you need to do is sign in with Twitter and you're ready to go. Twitter is linked to each author's account thus enabling readers and writers to carry conversations away from the site and draw new readers back to it too. Once you're logged in, choosing a collection or individual piece to start reading is quick thanks to the scrollable spacious layout. Each article is devoid of clutter and distraction, allowing you to stay focused on the content. Through its use of empty space, Medium really emphasizes the main attraction-the words. There are so many things to get distracted by online and I really appreciate this approach. The designers seem to recognize this and have created a space for readers to feel at ease as their eyes graze the words on-screen. I imagine their design team brainstorming in a room together, throwing out adjectives that should be evoked by their product: clean, easy, simple, relaxing, focused, elegant. Needless to say, they've definitely conveyed these adjectives in their design. Medium has established itself as a mainstay for casual readers and writers alike.</p>
			<h3><a href="http://www.soundcloud.com">SoundCloud.com</a></h3>
			<p>I'm a self-described music-discovery addict. That means I spend a large chunk of my time seeking out and listening to music that I've never heard before. On a daily basis I will listen to more unfamiliar music than familiar music... and I listen to music for 4-5 hours a day (most of my listening happens during my walking-commute or at work, where I don't have to interface with people too often). Lucky for me, SoundCloud is the near ideal website for this. As any Twitter or Instagram user knows, it's fairly easy to follow new accounts. You become aware of them through sidebar suggestions or through tags/hashtags. SoundCloud has taken this approach to enable a customized stream of songs from artists and accounts you follow. Since I follow over 100 accounts this site serves up a few hours of new music to me every day.</p>
			<p>SoundCloud has taken the basic layout of a Twitter stream, except there are audio players on each posting en lieu of 140 character witticisms (meta-information for each songs is located on individual song pages). The stream is the main attraction when you're on any part of the site. Streams are populated with large orange-accented horizontal bars populated with an audio volume histogram. As a song plays, the current place in the song is marked by the same orange color populating the audio volume graph from left to right. Taking a step back from the stream, the site is pretty busy. There is a static header with a search bar and account-related links and sidebars with multiple sections on either side of the stream, which populates the center of the page. In a few words: bright, sectional, cluttered.</p>
			<p>This site is great because it offers so much flexibility to the user on what they can get out of it. For the listener it's a great way to hear and replay music (you can make your own playlists and share them). It's also great for artists in every stage of their career because it enables them to put out their music to be listened to, reposted (like a retweet) and discovered by others. It also enables artists of niche genres (there's a hashtag for every genre out there) to connect with their followings and be inspired by similar artists. SoundCloud's algorithms suggest similar artists and "what you might like to listen to next" based on listening history, followership and other unbeknownst pattern-identifying computer magic.</p>
			<p>SoundCloud aims to be fun, functional (you could say they put the 'fun' in 'functional'), social, viral and logical. I think there is a small disconnect between how the site looks and how they want to focus the experience. I think the biggest problem is the clutter. I imagine they could design away the clutter while still keeping most of the functionality (perhaps by using more mouse hover functions). It might also take a redesign of the typical page layout. Still, it is not hard to navigate around the site-finding a specific artist/song/genre page is best accomplished by using the search bar in the header. As with Twitter, browsing to old content is not easy. This could probably be rectified with something like Facebook's timeline feature. A benefit to having spent a lot of time on the site is the fact that I have amassed a large collection of 'favorites'.  The option to play all of my favorites in sequence on demand is very satisfying. Although I sometimes feel like I've wasted a lot of time sorting through music I didn't necessarily like too much. Overall, SoundCloud is a very functional and enjoyable experience but they have a little work to be done in the visual design department that could make them that much better.</p>
			<h3><a href="http://www.mistermoneymustache.com">MrMoneyMustache.com</a></h3>
			<p>Mr. Money Mustache (MMM) is a pretty average dude who just happened to retire not long after his 30th birthday. Now he lives off of the income from his passive assets and blogs about his financial strategies and lifestyle choices. I was raised with a pretty keen sense of how to use my time and resources logically and how to be frugal, but MMM has transformed my approach to these concepts to the next level. He invokes financial advice all over the place, which is great because I never had a formal financial education, and he challenges the typical train of thought on many other fronts. He's empowering, inspiring and funny, which is why I like to read his blog.</p>
			<p>MMM's blog recently got a much-needed redesign and it now does a much better job at introducing new readers to the content. The main page features a large header and new logo and a mustached man in a top hat, surrounded by 6 links that direct users to the main features on the site. Below that are smaller sections that will direct readers to more specific posts (featured, latest, classics) as well as a section to subscribe to the newsletter. Browsing through the site's entire content is a piece of cake because MMM has included a link encouraging readers to check out all the posts starting at the very beginning of the blog. The design is functional, easy on the eyes and does a good job at getting new visitors interested and signed up. Visually, it can be described as rustic, sectional, manly, handmade, natural.</p>
			<p>MMM aims to inspire his readers to change their lifestyle to become financially independent. He espouses low-spending with a high savings rate. Most of his posts focus on ways to reduce spending while also tacking certain trains of thought that cause people to spend more than they need (i.e. owning/driving a car as opposed to waking, biking or public transportation). Content-wise MMM's style is practical, logical, funny, sarcastic, empowering. This deviates a bit from the appearance of the site, but I think this is intentional. MMM's approach is just how he encourages readers to become financially independent, something he often refers to as "bad-ass", which is reflected in the visual design of the website. I enjoy spending time reading MMM because it keeps me motivated to reach my own personal goal of financial independence.</p>
