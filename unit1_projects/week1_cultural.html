				That fireside chat video got me super stoked on DBC. It solidified everything I had read and heard about the program, and it was especially powerful to hear it from the founder himself with so much conviction. Shareef really believes in the program and he believes in us and that gives me a ton of confidence coming into it.

				I know DBC is going to be a ton of work, and I'm really excited for it because it's been a long while since I've done any work that has driven and motivated me. I recognize the engaging nature of the culture and I expect that I will be a good fit. I like to be part of a team and I like to work together and relate with others. I think this is one of my strong suits so I think it will help me learn quickly.

				My expectations of DBC have changed a bit since I first looked into it. My initial impression of coding schools was that it was a package to be consumed, as Shareef alluded to in his fireside chat. However this impression fizzled when I started to do my own research online and chatted with students who had been through the program. If anything, my shift of perception has got me more pumped because I realize that I can get more out of it depending on what I put in. And having paid for this with money I earned, I definitely want to make the most of my money. Thinking about what I have ahead of me makes me a little nervous, but it's a good thing. It's like standing at the bottom of an enormous mountain and looking up to the top, shrouded in clouds and thinking... "I'll be up there in 18 weeks, but I know the climb is fraught with unknown obstacles and setbacks, maybe even a fire-breathing dragon".
